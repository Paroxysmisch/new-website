## About me
I am a fourth year computer science student interested in applying Geometric Deep Learning (mostly Graph Neural Networks) and Neural Algorithmic Reasoning to real-world problems. My interests include accelerating Computational Genomics/Bioinformatics, Computer Architecture, Natural Language Processing, and Graphics with machine learning. I am currently working on the use of GNNs and NAR for accelerating de novo genome assembly.

## Academic interests
!!! note "Geometric Deep Learning"
    is a field of machine learning that extends traditional deep learning to handle data with complex geometric structures, such as graphs, point clouds, and meshes. Instead of focusing solely on Euclidean data like images or sequences, GDL explores how to apply deep learning techniques to non-Euclidean domains, leveraging the inherent symmetries and structures of these data types.
